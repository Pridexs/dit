# Testing folder
This is a folder that contains scripts to run tests in the API.  
  
It consists of two shell scripts test.sh and setup.sh  
  
test.sh is to actually test the api.  
setup.sh is to, as the file says, setup docker and should be run in the machine that will run the server to create images and containers so that there is something to test.
